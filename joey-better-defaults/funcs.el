;; Often when editing code one wishes to open a line just under the current one, which is properly indented relative to the existing code, and position the cursor at its beginning. Such a feature is present in most IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and NetBeans. It’s usually bound to Shift+Enter. Emacs has a command open-line, which sadly behave nothing like I’d want it to - it just breaks the current line and inserts one (or more) empty line afterwards. Luckily in the land of Emacs any shortfall is correctable with a bit of Emacs Lisp. Just add this snippet to your .emacs (or .emacs.d/init.el or whatever):
